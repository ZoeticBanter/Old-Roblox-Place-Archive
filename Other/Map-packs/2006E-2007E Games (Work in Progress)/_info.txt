Thanks for checking out this small little project I'm making for the Wayback Machine.

This map-pack was made with 06/early 07 games me and my friends have found over the years. It doesn't have *every* single old game, but a majority of the "good" ones. If you have a suggestion for a game, join the server at the end of the file.
Games like Bloxxer City and Lava Rush are missing since they are NOT '06 games - rather games published in PG'ed 2006 accounts. 
(Lava Rush was stolen from an uncopylocked 2006 Roblox remake by orange451 from 2010)

With that being said, if you would like a bigger map-pack I'm making with my friends, check out Rchive. This map-pack includes games from 2006 to 2017 and has an always expanding library =)
