==WARNING==

PLEASE DO NOT CLAIM THESE AS YOUR OWN!!!! You did not make any of these, and though I have no rights to say this, just do not claim anyone's games as yours. This is entirely for preservation and educational purposes, not as a way for you to steal people's games. I take NO credit for all of the games in here!
You MIGHT also get banned for reuploading other people's games, so be aware, if you reupload any of these, be careful.
For 07 games, check the folder in 'Others' by the name of 'Map-packs" then '2007 Game Collection (Work in Progress)'


Now, time for the real introduction of this.

=
Thank you for downloading the Roblox Archive Pack "RCHIVE"! This project was made completely out of passion and how much I appreciate old Roblox stuff in general. The entire purpose of this project is to preserve Roblox history before these games get eventually copylocked/compromised/etc. This project has been in the works since June 2021, and I hope you find some use to these places! Some places here are not in other game archives, such as 2010 Dodgeball, etc. 

With that being said though, here's some information about it, including our sources for the games and a few other small things.

1. How were these games obtained?
First of all, these were mostly obtained by me (FedeDoesStuff) and my friend RENATOKS via uncopylocked places - Some of the games here were obtained by other people
and we have put them here to make our library of classic Roblox games bigger. We take no credit finding the games that we did not obtain. Credits will be at the end of this file.

2. Do these games work?
Possibly not. A lot of these games are very old - most have not received fixes for 5 years or more - and some were obtained through the .dll injector exploit that was going around from 2010 to 2012. A majority of these weren't tested either.

3. How do I get a game taken down from here?
Contact my Roblox account @OldGameArchive and I'll update this file to not have your game. Thank you.

4. This project would not have been possible without these people:

And thanks to EVERYONE who has uncopylocked or leaked games over the years. verm, the first group of people to use the place stealing exploit (Exaltation, DemonReaper, ProxyWorm, ID18, etc (the original ExPro group). And also to the person that made that one map-pack with a bunch of places uploaded in May 2012. I have yet to find out who made it.
